# Cartoon Sounds
 ## by Coldblooded and Grimmier

 ## Description: 
 
 This script plays custom sounds for various events in game.

 Original concept and Code by Coldblooded

 He wrote the C code and initial implimentation.

 I took this and ran with it adding a GUI and more sounds / events.

## Features
 
 * Comes with Customizable sounds and volume settings. configurable in the config window.
 
 * You can add any .wav file to the sound folder and it will be available to use by name.
 
 * You can also sort your sounds folder by sub folders and reference that folder instead of the default.
 * * This is useful if you want to have different sounds for different characters.
 
 In the future I may add the ability to add custom events from the GUI.
